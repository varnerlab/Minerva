// Types -
g_ are types of GENE_SYMBOLS;
mRNA_ are types of mRNA_SYMBOLS;
p_ are types of PROTEIN_SYMBOLS;
m_ are types of METABOLITE_SYMBOLS;

// What genes do we have in the model?
(g_xynP,g_xynB,g_xylA,g_xylB,g_xylR,g_ccpA,g_Hpr,g_HprK,g_eI,g_eIIA,g_eIIB and g_IIC) = GENE_SYMBOLS;

// General gene expression and translation
RNAP transcribes my GENE_SYMBOLS;
RIBOSOME translates my mRNA_SYMBOLS;

// Transcriptional control mechanisms -
(p_xylR|p_ccpA_pHpr-S46) represses the expression of (g_xynP,g_xynB,g_xylA,g_xylB);

// Allosteric regulation mechanism -
m_xylose inhibits (p_xylR or p_dfsT);
m_g6P activates p_xylR;
